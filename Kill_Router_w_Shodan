Tool to break administrative passwords for wireless routers, routers, switches and other authenticated network service management platforms.

 

clone this repo and make sure you have python installed on your system

Now install dependencies This step is optional, just to make sure you have all the python libraries that the script uses.

 

# git clone https://github.com/msfidelis/Kill-Router-.git  

KillRouter is a simple mega script that I created during an experiment where I needed a tool that would aid me in a brute force of simple passwords on a router authenticated via JavaScript. Asking for help from Dr. Google and college students, thank you Gambler, I found a method of sending the request along with the user request and password in the header to the router. Of course there is the THC Hydra project, which I like very much, in this aspect the tool leaves a little something to be desired in terms of performance, and may even send missing requests out there, and this led me to think of a way to simplify the process and Execute the operation in a way almost 3 times faster using Python.

 

# cd Kill-Router-/  
# chmod +x install-kill-router.sh  
# ./install-kill-router.sh  ```
